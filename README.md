# ARC
### This repository is for sharing the Synthiam Arc builds HRC used for the baseline testing of VR controls for the InMoov robot. While it performed well at first, its capabilities were found lacking for the depth of control we wanted. We are switching to Unity for more robust VR controls, but we are uploading this in the while the Unity VR Controls are still a WIP.
